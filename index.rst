TDRH Version 2 Package
======================

.. important:: In the spring of 2023, a new TDEM OcTree code (TDRH v2) was compiled. The TDRH v2 code uses a universally right-handed coordinate system; as opposed to the modified left-handed coordinate system used by `TDoctree v2 <https://tdoctree.readthedocs.io/en/tdoctree_v2/>`__. TDRH v2 is also capable of modeling the secondary field, which is useful when data are collected during the on-time (e.g. UTEM).

TDRH version 2 is a program library for carrying out forward modelling and inversion of time domain EM data over 3D structures. The contents of this manual are as follows:
